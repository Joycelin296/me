TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
ex3: while loop for rejecting not numbers, confusing, I don't know what I'm doing wrong as code does run properly.

("OK then, a number between {}".format(lowerBound) + " and {} ?".format(upperBound))
(f"OK then, a number between {lowerBound}" + f" and {upperBound} ?"

while loops can be infinite


stubborn asker program doesn't run, but passes the test.?
